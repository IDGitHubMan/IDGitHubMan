### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Isaiah.

 I am a student who mostly programs for fun. I'm making things with Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and Java.
 
 Right now, I'm in a yearlong intensive Full Stack Development course, as a Pursuit Fellow.

I recently released an app! You can check it out [here](https://iddude.itch.io/genera) if you're interested. While that is still an ongoing process, I'm also working on building some websites for myself, as well as a few weird and random projects:

- A nice portfolio with Github Pages (still in beginning)
- A live website for me and other people to host projects (Still in beginning)
- A music player/visualizer app (The visualization is there, but the actual interface is non-existent)
- Some animation
