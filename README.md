### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Isaiah.

 I am a student who mostly programs for fun. I'm making things with Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and maybe a little java. I'm working on a lot right now...ðŸ˜†

But I recently released an app! You can check it out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IDDev.nodes) if you're interested. While that is still an ongoing process, I'm also working on building some websites for myself, as well as a few weird and random projects.
