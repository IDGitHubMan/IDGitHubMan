### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isaiah. I am a student (applying to college) who mostly programs for fun. I'm currently working on not only a Github pages page, but also an android app that collects a variety of tools and toys in Android Studio. I program in Python, Processing, HTML, CSS, JS, and am learning Pyret among other things. I can be reached at idguy2021@gmail.com.
